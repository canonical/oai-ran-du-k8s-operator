      description: |
        Run DU in simulation mode.
        In the simulation mode, the DU emulates the Radio Unit (RU) which, in real deployment, would have been a physical device connected to the DU. Simulation mode has been designed to work with the OAI RAN NR UE (a simulated 5G User Equipment).
    use-three-quarter-sampling:
      type: boolean
      default: false
      description: |
        This parameter enables three-quarter sampling on DU by adding -E flag to DU startup command. 
        This flag might be required to split 8 sample rate to run DU connected to physical devices (such as USRP B210).
