    cni-type:
      type: string
      default: bridge
      description: |
        Multus CNI plugin to use for the interfaces.
        Allowed values are `bridge`, `macvlan`.
    f1-interface-name:
      type: string
      default: "f1"
      description: Name of the network interface handling communication over the F1 interface.
    f1-ip-address:
      type: string
      default: "192.168.254.5/24"
      description: DU F1 interface IP Address in CIDR format
    f1-port:
      type: int
      default: 2152
      description: Number of the port handling communication over the F1 interface.
    simulation-mode:
      type: boolean
      default: false
      description: |
        Run DU in simulation mode.
        In the simulation mode, the DU emulates the Radio Unit (RU) which, in real deployment, would have been a physical device connected to the DU. Simulation mode has been designed to work with the OAI RAN NR UE (a simulated 5G User Equipment).
    use-three-quarter-sampling:
      type: boolean
      default: false
      description: |
        This parameter enables three-quarter sampling on DU by adding -E flag to DU startup command. This flag might be required to split 8 sample rate to run DU connected to physical devices (such as USRP B210).
    center-frequency:
      type: string
      description: |
        Middle frequency (in MHz) of the band to use for this DU. The frequency needs to be in the 5G FR1 range, from 410 MHz to 7125 MHz.
    bandwidth:
      type: int
      description: |
        The width of radio frequencies, centered on the center frequency given in MHz. 
        The supported bandwidth in FR1 5G is between 5 MHz to 100 MHz.
    frequency-band:
      type: int
      description: |
        5G NR frequency band, without the 'N' prefix. The chosen band must be
        in the FR1 range and use TDD multiplexing. The supported bands are:
        34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 46, 47, 48, 50, 51, 53, 54, 77, 78, 79, 90, 96, 101, 102.
    sub-carrier-spacing:
      type: int
      description: | 
        The distance between two adjacent sub-carriers given in kHz. 
        As FR1 5G spectrum supports 15, 30, 60 kHz sub-carrier spacing, it should be one of these values.
    use-mimo:
      type: boolean
      default: false
      description: |
        When set to true enabled support for 2x2 MIMO.
